        <h1>About</h1>
        <div>Bay Area Hackathons (not to be confused by the sub-standard hackathon of the same name) is a student organization of hackathon-goers in, as the name implies, the bay area. We've organized our organization from the beginning as a hacker-centric community, meant to help connect kids with opportunities - making computer science and Hackathons as inclusive as possible.</div>
        <div>We hold humble origins as a small discord community, where kids talk about hackathons and programming. However since then we've grown into an organization that not only promotes hackathons, but maintains a standard of quality for hackathons in the bay area. Think of us as the better business bureau - we uphold a standard of quality meant to increase the overall experience of programming events in the bay area.</div>
